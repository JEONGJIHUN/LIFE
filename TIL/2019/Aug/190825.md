### 1. Be less dependent on third party libraries and try to understand the core language.

-  you must know and understand how the core JS language works and not depend on large catch-all libraries which are often filled with crappy code.

### 2. Focus on ONE framework (React).

- By focusing on one framework and not trying to learn everything you can target these job openings and do much better on technical interviews.

### 3. Rudimentary database knowledge.

- Showing interest in SQL will thus mark you as almost unique and certainly someone that is worth employing.

### 4. Testing.

- Having useful test coverage gives you confidence that the code works as intended and you can deploy with far less risk to messing up your production environments. It also increases safety and stability of the code when multiple people are working on a larger project since itâ€™s impossible for everyone to know everything about a project and when you make a code change you might break something by mistake. Properly testing a project can save you a lot of pain by mitigating mistakes and disasters!
